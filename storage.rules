// Best-practice security rules for Firebase Storage.
//
// 1. All paths are denied by default.
// 2. Only authenticated users can access Storage.
// 3. Users can only read/write to their own private folder.
// 4. The `userId` in the path MUST match the UID of the authenticated user.
// 5. File uploads must be less than 5MB.

                          && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024;
