    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure secure and scalable document management for VaultLock. We leverage path-based ownership for user profiles and documents to simplify security rules and maintain data integrity.\n\n1.  **User Profiles:** User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection, ensuring that each user's data is isolated and directly accessible using their `userId`. This structure aligns with the principle of path-based ownership.\n\n2.  **Documents:** Documents are stored in a subcollection `/users/{userId}/documents/{documentId}`, establishing a clear ownership hierarchy. Each document's `userId` field is redundant but critical for authorization independence. Security rules can directly verify the user's ID against the document's `userId` without needing to perform additional `get()` operations. This denormalization is a key design principle for VaultLock.\n\nThis structure facilitates simple and robust security rules. For example, a rule to allow a user to read their own documents would be straightforward:\n\n```\nmatch /users/{userId}/documents/{documentId} {\n  allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId;\n}\n```\n\nThis design ensures that the system can scale efficiently and maintain data integrity as the number of users and documents grows."
